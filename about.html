      <p class="text-md">Mind Over Muscle is a student-led initiative to raise awareness about mental health challenges faced by athletes. Whether you're dealing with pressure, anxiety, burnout, or just need someone to talk to — you're not alone.</p>
      <p class="text-md mt-4">As an artistic swimmer, I’ve faced the physical and mental challenges that come with balancing high expectations and the pressure to perform. The mental and emotional toll this takes is significant, and it made me realize how important it is to talk about mental health in sports. It's crucial to acknowledge that just like physical fitness, mental resilience needs support and attention. Through this project, I hope to help others who may feel overwhelmed by these challenges.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My Journey in Artistic Swimming</h3>
    <p class="text-md">I first dove into artistic swimming when I was 10 years old — and it’s been a huge part of my life ever since. Over the years, I’ve committed countless hours to training, while also juggling schoolwork, academics, and other extracurriculars. Balancing all these responsibilities hasn’t always been easy, and there were times when the mental pressure felt overwhelming.</p>
    <p class="text-md mt-4">As a top-level artistic swimmer, I’ve been honored to compete on the U.S. National Team and represent the USA at international competitions, earning placements both nationally and internationally. Through this journey, I've seen firsthand how common mental health struggles are — not just in artistic swimming, but across all sports. I've met so many incredible athletes who have felt the same weight of expectations, burnout, and pressure.</p>
    <p class="text-md mt-4">This is why Mind Over Muscle matters so much to me. No one should feel alone in their struggles. Together, we can start honest conversations about mental health in sports — and support one another every step of the way.</p>
