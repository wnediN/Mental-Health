      <p class="text-md">Mind Over Muscle is a student-led initiative to raise awareness about mental health challenges faced by athletes. Whether you're dealing with pressure, anxiety, burnout, or just need someone to talk to — you're not alone.</p>
      <p class="text-md mt-4">As an artistic swimmer, I’ve faced the physical and mental challenges that come with balancing high expectations and the pressure to perform. The mental and emotional toll this takes is significant, and it made me realize how important it is to talk about mental health in sports. It's crucial to acknowledge that just like physical fitness, mental resilience needs support and attention. Through this project, I hope to help others who may feel overwhelmed by these challenges.</p>
